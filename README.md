Mr David is playing a word-linking game. In this game, a word is considered to be linked to the previous word if at least one letter at the beginning of the word matches the last letter of the previous word. Create a program that can take two words as input and determine whether these two words can be used in the word-linking game. If they can, the program should also display the longest subword that can link the two given words.

Mrs Jane considers a number to be "beautiful" if all its digits are the same and not equal to zero (e.g., 333, 5, 44). Given a number x that is not divisible by 2 and not divisible by 5 (in other words, relatively prime with 10), create a program that takes input x and returns the smallest beautiful number that is divisible by x.
